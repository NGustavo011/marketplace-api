# Marketplace API (marketplace-api)

The Marketplace API empowers users to buy and sell products. Users can interact with the platform to facilitate transactions and manage their listings. The application is focused on a robust implementation of the Clean Architecture. You can explore and interact with the API through the available routes and also view the documentation on Swagger UI accessible via `/api-docs`.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine before proceeding.

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NGustavo011/marketplace-api.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd marketplace-api
```

Install the dependencies using npm:

```sh
npm install
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn
```

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server using the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

or using yarn:

```sh
yarn dev

This will start the server, and you can access the API locally. Access the Swagger documentation at http://localhost:PORT/api-docs in your browser, where PORT is the configured port for the server.

## Clean Architecture
Marketplace API is built with a focus on the Clean Architecture principles to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and extensibility.
